### 💡 App Workflow:
This app comes with a unique feature to limit the number of login attempts:
- **Login Attempts:** You have **5 attempts** to enter the correct credentials (Username: Admin, Password: 1234).
- If you fail all 5 attempts, even if you enter the correct credentials afterward, you **cannot log in**.
- This feature helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures a better user experience.

Feel free to modify the number of attempts or improve this feature as needed!
